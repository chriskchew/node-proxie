Summary
=======

The beginnings of a node-based REST proxy as an implementation of the [Gateway pattern](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/gateway.html).

The goal is to support parallelized and/or sequential REST calls, and to extract pieces of the downstream responses into an aggregate object suitable for a response.
